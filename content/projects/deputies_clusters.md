**Clustering Russian Deputies** is a project done in 2013 at Ria Novosty Studio of Infographics. Project explores how actual votes of Russian deputies are revealing underlying political structures and fractions, and how that behaviour changes based on the topics of the laws. It also higlights how specific deputies voted on key issues, such as Prohibition of international adoption of Russian children, and some others.

Unfortunately, project is removed from the site now.
