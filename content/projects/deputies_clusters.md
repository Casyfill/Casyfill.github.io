## Clustering Russian Deputies

![clustering](../static/ria/vis-gosduma-cluster.png)

**Clustering Russian Deputies** is a project done in 2013 at *Ria Novosti Studio of Infographics*. Project explores how actual votes of Russian deputies are revealing underlying political structures and fractions, and how that behavior changes based on the topics of the laws. It also highlights how specific deputies voted on key issues, such as Prohibition of international adoption of Russian children, and some others.

Unfortunately, project itself is removed from the site now, but here is a review (and archived screenshot)
