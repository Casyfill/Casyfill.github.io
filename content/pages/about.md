My name is Philipp Kats, I am a data scientist and tinkerer with inerests in HCI, Design, Data Visualisation, Data Journalism, Urban Planning and Architecture. Quite a list. I was born in Kazan, Russia (I usually explain it as roughly "Austin of Russia"), for the last 6 years I learn to be a NewYorker. I hold a BA in Architecture, Masters in Urban Informatics from NYU, and also graduated from [Strelka Institute](https://strelka.com/en), studying under Carlo Ratty and Rem Koolhaas. 

Through my career I worked as Architectural designer (2009-2012), Urban planner, lecturer (2012-2014), Data journalist, project manager at Ria Novosti(2012-2015), Data scientist at StreetEasy (2015-...).

As a volunteer and lecturer I have experience teaching in Universities (ITMO, Highter School of Economics), Hight Schools (Basics of data science), held and organized numerous public workshops and presentations.
