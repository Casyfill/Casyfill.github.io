Hi! My name is Philipp Kats, I am a data scientist with focus on product development, spatial and network analysis. I am passionate about building tools, products and processes. I was born in Kazan, Russia, but lived in New York for the past 6 years. I hold a Specialist degree in Architectural design, Masters in Urban Informatics from NYU, also graduated from [Strelka Institute Senseable Moscow Lab](https://strelka.com/en), studying under Carlo Ratty and Rem Koolhaas. 

Through my career I worked as Architectural designer (2009-2012), Urban planner, lecturer (2012-2014), Data journalist at Ria Novosti(2012-2015). For the last 5 years (2015-...) I am working as a Data scientist at StreetEasy (Zillow). I also love to work with people and frequently volunteer as a lecturer and tutor, having taught at ITMO University (Saint Petersburg, Russia), Higher School of Economics (Moscow, Russia), and a course on computer science for Hight School students in Kazan, Russia).
